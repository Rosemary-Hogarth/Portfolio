### Project Description
This is a static portfolio website for presenting my work as a developer. I wanted to create something visually pleasing that wouldn't distract from my actual web development projects.
I started the project by designing each page in Figma for mobile and desktop. On the homepage I added my own drawing of the TV Tower in Berlin to create a fun, welcoming feel.
